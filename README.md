# hsmata

A simple implementation of deterministic automata in Haskell. For learning purpose.

## Goals

The goal is to:

1. Read the description of an automata from a file
2. Parse it and create a representation of it in memory
3. Be able to simulate state transitions and acceptance of patterns

## File format

TODO
